Drag an Amplitude song folder onto samplitude.exe, and .wav files will start
being generated inside the folder, one per MIDI track.

Or, drag the folder onto reaper.bat, and a "project.RPP" for the REAPER DAW
software will be generated, along with folders of extracted samples for each
bank (referenced by the RPP file).
